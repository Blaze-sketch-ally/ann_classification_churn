# Summary
This project aims to predict the likelihood of customer churn in a banking environment using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.
Customer churn refers to the probability that a customer will stop using a company‚Äôs services ‚Äî a key metric for customer retention and business growth.

The model analyzes various customer attributes such as age, credit score, account balance, estimated salary, and product usage to determine how likely a customer is to leave the bank.

A Streamlit web application is developed to provide an interactive user interface, allowing users to input customer details and instantly visualize the predicted churn probability.

This system can help banks or service-based organizations identify customers at risk of leaving, so they can take proactive steps to improve satisfaction and retention.
